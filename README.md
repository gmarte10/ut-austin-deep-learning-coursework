# UT Austin Deep Learning Homework Repository

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Homework Repository** for the University of Texas at Austin. This repository contains my homework assignments completed as part of the Deep Learning course in my master's program in computer science. Each assignment has been edited to remove components such as the grader or other content that could be misused.

## Repository Overview

The assignments in this repository cover a range of topics in deep learning, including:

- Fundamentals of neural networks
- Backpropagation
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformer architectures
- Optimization techniques
- Regularization methods
- Applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and more

Each homework folder contains:

- **Code**: Python scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks with my implementations of the assignments.
- **Readme files**: Where applicable, documentation specific to individual assignments.
- **Data**: Input files required for the homework (where permissible to share).
- **Results**: Output logs, visualizations, and/or model evaluations.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning. Note that while the repository contains functional implementations, some parts have been intentionally removed to prevent misuse.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository, use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmarte10/ut-austin-deep-learning.git
```

## Important Notes

1. **Educational Use Only**: The content in this repository is shared strictly for educational purposes. Please do not use it to violate any academic integrity policies.
2. **Incomplete Components**: As mentioned, certain elements (e.g., grading scripts) have been removed.
